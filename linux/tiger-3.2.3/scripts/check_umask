# check_umask - 04/15/2003
#
# Check for umask setting in configuration files. This check has been 
# separated from check_logfiles since it's a broader check. The command
# requirements have been modified to adjust to what it's really needed.
#
# 01/13/2004 - jfs - Fixed syntax error in the previous patch
# 10/19/2003 - jfs - Applied patch from Ryan Bradetich adding 077 umask
#              to the valid list.
# 08/09/2003 - jfs - Fixed the script so it does not grok if no valid
#              umask entries are available
# 05/01/2003 - jfs - Fixed dependancies
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TODO
# The script will not work properly if the 'umask' string is present 
# in the script but it's not a valid call to the umask setting. 
# It will not work properly either if more than 3 occurances of umask are 
# present.
