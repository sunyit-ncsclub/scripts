# check_passwdformat - jfs - October 2002
#
# 10/13/2002 - check_passwdformat
#       This script checks the format of the /etc/passwd file in order to
#       determine inconsistencies which indicate an intrusion 
#       or misconfiguration.
#       This script is based on SuSE's and OpenBSD's daily security check.
# 08/08/2003 - jfs - Improved temporary file creation.
# 10/07/2003 - jfs - Delete temporary files created.
# 10/10/2003 - jfs - Improved message and allowed daemon in uid 1 (for
#                    debian bug #211328). Also added password content 
#                    check and do not warn on lengths for locked users.
#                    (fixes debian bug 211327). Finally, added missing
#                    temporary files to removal and safe_temp calls
# 11/19/2003 - jfs - Removed shadow password check (per patch from Ryan
#                    Bradetich) and added note for other systems (non
#                    HPUX or Linux)
# 01/15/2004 - jfs - Fixed password definitions (Debian bug #227596) adding
#                    the sets 'g-Z' 'A-Z' and '.'
# 06/28/2004 - jfs - Modified to avoid duplicate error messages for the same
#                    stuff in passwd and shadow files
# 12/27/2004 - jfs - Maximum user and group length set to 32 (Debian bug #283446)
# 07/05/2006 - jfs - Fix deprecated syntax with sort.  Thanks to Cyril
#                    Chaboisseau and Adam James for providing a patch (Debian
#                    bug: #369501)
