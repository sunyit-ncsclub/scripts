Many additional security features are available when running the
system in trusted mode. It is recommended that you enable trusted
mode through SAM. You can find more information on the major
differences between trusted and non-trusted modes in the HP-UX FAQ
http://www.faqs.org/faqs/hp/hpux-faq/section-68.html
and at the HP document "Administering your HP-UX Trusted System"
(B2355-90121) available at

When the system is in trusted mode, HP-UX can enforce a default
number of login attempts before the account is disabled.  This
is useful for preventing potential intruders from brute forcing
and/or guessing passwords.  Since limiting the number of logins
can also be used as a Denial of Service attack, the number of
login attempts is configurable on a per-user basis.  Read the
default(4) and modprpw(1M) man pages for additional information.
