# check_trusted: Verifies the system is running in trusted mode.
# For more information on trusted mode in HP-UX please read
# http://docs.hp.com/hpux/onlinedocs/B2355-90121/B2355-90121.html 
# Tested on HP-UX 11.11, HP-UX 11.00, and HP-UX 10.20.
#
# 06/25/2003 rbradetich@uswest.net - Initial release
# 06/26/2003 jfs - Added a TODO item, added a check to see if GETPRDEF is
#                  available.
# 08/09/2003 jfs - Patch from Ryan Bradetich which adds a check to determine
#                  system will lock accounts after a number of failed attempts.
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TODO:
# - HP documentation says that only HP-UX Release 10.10 and later support
# enabling trusted mode. Consider including a check to determine we
# are not in an _ancient_ system
#
# - This check can be improved in the future to possibly specify the 
#   number of failed login attempts, etc.
