README for audit scripts
------------------------

The audit scripts are a set of scripts intented to be run in systems
to recover useful information for them. The information recovered
should be sufficient to do a "white box" analysis of the system.
These scripts are targeted at systems where running an "advanced" 
(or complex) tool such as Tiger, Titan or the CIS scoring tool is
 not an option, this is typical on production systems where 
installation of tools is "out of bounds" or where the system 
administrator wants to review the code of the tool that is going to be used.

The suite of scripts is made of simple shell scripts (and a batch
file for Windows 2000/XP/2003) that will extract the relevant
information from the system (installed software and patches,
permissions, TCP/IP listeners, processes, etc.) and allow you to review
that information manually and fill in the appropiate checklist.

These scripts are derived from Marc Heuse's set of audit scripts [1].
Similar tools include Seán Boran's UNIX/Linux local audit tool [2].
They can be run through a system console and will just generate a 
pack of information that can be transfered for an external system for
analysis.

The audit scripts have been tested on AIX, Debian GNU/Linux, Red
Hat Linux, SuSE Linux, HPUX, Solaris and Windows (2000, 2003 and XP).
