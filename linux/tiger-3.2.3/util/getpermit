# util/getpermit - 04/22/93
#
# 04/28/93 dls  Added '-L' to 'ls' to get permissions from file instead of
#               symbolic link.
# 10/28/2002 jfs LS and AWK are no longer hardcoded
# 08/11/2003 jfs getpermit now interates through more than one name and 
#            aborts with error if the file or directory does not exist.
